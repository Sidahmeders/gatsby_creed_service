Over the years, the capability of artificial intelligence (AI) has increased manifold. After dominating humans in objective disciplines, AI is starting to venture into subjective disciplines that were always considered to be only within the realms of humans. The normal cognitive intelligence acquired by humans follows a methodical and linear process. The current genre of AI, attempts to imitate within an acceptable range. Businesses are aggressively experimenting AI across spaces that range from logical to creative and rational to reflexive. The technological displacement of human thinking is starting and technology is in the process of replacing blue, white, purple, and pink-collar jobs. As of now, the human monopoly in protected only in the thinking spaces such as intuition, self-awareness, meta-cognition, and generalization of wisdom.

It may be difficult for AI to challenge a person in the discipline where she or he scores very high, but it could beat them in the other disciplines where the scores are not optimal. The basic intelligence human beings gain across every discipline follows a well-defined methodical procedure. In spite of this process-driven factory approach, the actual intelligence varies from one individual to the other.

Similar to the basic human intelligence, the intelligence acquired by AI algorithms are also methodical and follows a laid down process. The intelligence level of an algorithm depends on the following three aspects

The quality of the training data
The sophistication of the algorithms used to build a model that could discern similar patterns from the actual data
Ongoing learning the model undergoes to keep its intelligence refreshed and relevant
When the data and method pertaining to any discipline of intelligence are fed to AI systems, they can scale-up intelligence in that space in no time. This is the reason why analysis and logical reasoning became the first prey for AI systems (AIS). With the help of extensive data and advanced algorithms, the AIS are able to perform many of the sensory functions humans do. AIS are now starting to even synthesize appropriate human emotions while responding to human beings.

Creative thinking that is reflected in spaces like writing, art, and painting has remained untested by AIS until recently, but not anymore. As a major portion of these creative activities emanates from a methodical and pattern-based approach, AIS are able to train themselves and challenge human intelligence in those spaces as well. The aggressive growth of AIS portends a scary future for human intelligence. Not only its dominance but also its relevance is being challenged. AIS will be able to beat human intelligence with its brute speed, razor-sharp accuracy, impeccable consistency, the capability to handle complexity and tirelessness.
