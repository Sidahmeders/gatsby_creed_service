Although historians still speculate who ordered the attack, there is little doubt as to the identity of the killers. They were not monks, but members of a secretive Muslim sect with strongholds seated high in the mountains of Persia and Syria. Headquartered in an impenetrable Persian castle, Alamut, these agents specialized in targeted killings and espionage. Infiltrating the ranks of their enemies, they would strike their targets, often with knives, and were willing to die for their mission. Syrian enemies called them the Hashishim, but they are better known today by the European crusaders’ term: Assassins.


The dreaded Assassins were at the peak of their power in the 12th century. Much of what is believed about them comes from accounts of fascinated European crusaders and from the pens of their sworn enemies, Syrian Sunni chroniclers. Their very biased accounts must be taken with a degree of skepticism, for they were intended at times to entertain or defame. They extolled the Assassins' strength and zeal while making wild exaggerated claims about their lifestyles.

Although the sect did pass through a brief phase of libertinism in the 1160s, at most other times in its history the sect was very strict and austere. The use of hashish is not found in any credible Muslim source, even among the Assassins’ enemies. Middle Eastern historian and expert on the Assassins, Bernard Lewis believes that Hashishi was a popular Syrian term of abuse used by the sects’ enemies to discredit them.

Another medieval European misunderstanding was that the sect was specifically targeting Christians. In reality, there was considerable amicable contact between the crusaders and the sect. Around 1251 France’s Louis IX sent envoys to meet them. The meeting may have suited their diplomatic needs at the time, but the sect was largely uninterested in the Christians. It was primarily focused on the tumultuous changes in the Muslim world and the events that had shaped them, which they were also shaping in turn. Their story forms part of a great struggle between empires and local Muslim communities, between Arabs and non-Arabs, city and castle, and the Islamic world’s enduring dividing line—the bitter rivalry between Sunnis and Shiites.
